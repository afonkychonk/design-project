				We provide track and field all year and have multiple activities. These include the 100m (with hurdles and relay), 200m, 400m (with hurdles and relay), 800m, 1500m, and 3000m track events. There is also long jump, pole vaulting, shot put, and discus on the track. Training together with the rest of the athletics team builds teamwork even in solo events. The club competes with other regional schools throughout the year.

				Our basketball club is split into 2 groups by gender and a further 2 levels, A and B but can expand based on how many are interested. They are taught from basic to advanced skills by their skill level. Players also use communication and collaboration on the court to effective play the game. A regional tournament is held during the school year for our students to play against other teams.

				The football teams are similarly split by gender but with 3 different levels with coaching based on their preliminary performance, like all clubs, any student interested will be admitted to a team. A strong sense of community is built between team members through training and games. Two tournaments are held during the autumn and spring/summer season.
