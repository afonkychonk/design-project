				STEM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Maths. Our STEM club runs any of these related activities for members. Example activities include, building and testing a rocket and extracting DNA from strawberries. Many of our projects are completed in groups so that members can practice collaboration and communication with others. We hope to develop a community of problem-solvers and critical thinkers using hands-on activities that are both fun and challenging.

				The cooking club is for any student at any skill level in cooking. With guided instructions from skilled chefs, aspiring cooks will learn basic recipes while more practiced students will be able to learn new cultural dishes from our mixed background of students and cooks. A small fee is required to join the club to pay for food costs but with fundraisers throughout the year, this may be removed in the near future. Club members are encouraging to not only show their new skills to their family or friends but to help during international day.

				The school chess club helps train new players but also challenges those will higher ratings. Every week, the club invites a chess master to play against top players and to coach. The club has informal games with each other at similar skill levels and members can help each other to learn/practice chess. Some higher rating students will enter chess tournaments locally and progress to regional and even national competitions.

				Our robotics club is a group of students that want to learn and interact more about robots. Robotics clubs at school are usually held after school in a classroom and are moderated by a member of the teaching staff or the school administration. The club helps to make friends and build sense of community with like-minded members. Robotics teams provide the same opportunity for students to strengthen leadership skills, learn to cooperate with others, improve social interaction skills, better regulate emotions, and learn the highs and lows of competing.

				Model United Nations (MUN) is a simulation of the United Nations where members play the role of delegates and attempt to solve real issues with the policies and perspectives of their assigned country. Our students learn to develop confidence in speaking, research skills, awareness of global issues, and even make bonds with global students. We host multiple conferences with other schools throughout the year for our MUN club to have a better simulation.
