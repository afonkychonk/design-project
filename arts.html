				The art club is for any practicing artist to learn and refine skills, develop techniques, build portfolios, collaborate with other members, and create bonds with community through art. We complete some major projects that are shown in school including “studio night”. We contribute to the local community by assisting in events through activities like face painting, window painting, and arts advocacy.

				The school has a junior and senior orchestra to keep our musicians challenged. Junior orchestra members will be expected to know how to play an orchestral instrument, read notation, and practice for at least 60 mins a week. They will perform during the Winter and Summer concerts in front of the school. Senior orchestra members are expected to play equal or above an ABRSM grade 6 equivalent and are ready to learn more complex orchestral compositions. There are 5 public performances for the senior orchestra including a regional school competition. All orchestra members will collaborate with others and the conductors to perform well. They are expected to be respectful and courteous to others, open to feedback, and be able to be a team player and soloist.

				Students in the choir will continue their mastery of solfege, major and minor, and 4-part harmonies. They will also learn to implement dynamics, phrasing, and facial expression to improve their presentation. The choral music includes classical repertoire and pop music repertoire to broaden a member's ability. A strong bond is built between members who work together to produce the music of the choir.
