				For our new students, we pair multiple students to guide and explain the new school as equals. Students can opt as school ambassadors to fulfill this role. They share classes, discuss interests, and help to build a comfortable environment. By doing so, the Pitta School has been able to consistently integrate and develop a sense of belonging within our school community.
