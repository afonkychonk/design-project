			<p>
				Like our students, our staff and teachers come from a variety of different backgrounds. On average, our teachers speak 2.7 languages fluently: most commonly English. Most of the staff hold advanced degrees while the others are working towards one.  
			</p>
			<p>
				Our teachers are passionate about our studentâ€™s education physically, academically, and socially. We seek to obtain high standards for pedagogical leadership. Our staff members are accommodating to all students both new and old and know how to resolve conflicts in and out of the classroom setting.

				The aspects of our teachers are care for students, respect for international cultures, enthusiasm, and supporting student creativity. We care for our students by having counsellors, actively listening to students and their feedback. To respect the international student body teachers, use appropriate language, practice patience, encourage cultural exchange, and set the example for students to follow. All teachers are involved in the subject they educate outside of the school, they show great motivation to share their knowledge to students. We try to use active learning through student-led presentations, debates, discussions, group work, and projects.
